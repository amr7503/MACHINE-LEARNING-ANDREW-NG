    "- The output targets are the right answers to the model we'll learn from. To train the model, you feed the training set, both the input features and the output targets to your learning algorithm. Then your supervised learning algorithm will produce some function. We'll write this function as lowercase f, where f stands for function. Historically, this function used to be called a hypothesis, but I'm just going to call it a function f in this class. The job with f is to take a new input x and output and estimate or a prediction, which I'm going to call y-hat, and it's written like the variable y with this little hat symbol on top. \n",
    "- In machine learning, the convention is that y-hat is the estimate or the prediction for y. The function f is called the model. X is called the input or the input feature, and the output of the model is the prediction, y-hat. The model's prediction is the estimated value of y.\n",
    "-  When the symbol is just the letter y, then that refers to the target, which is the actual true value in the training set. In contrast, y-hat is an estimate. It may or may not be the actual true value."

    "-   You may ask, why are we choosing a linear function, where linear function is just a fancy term for a straight line instead of some non-linear function like a curve or a parabola? Well, sometimes you want to fit more complex non-linear functions as well, like a curve like this. But since this linear function is relatively simple and easy to work with, let's use a line as a foundation that will eventually help you to get to more complex models that are non-linear. This particular model has a name, it's called linear regression. More specifically, this is linear regression with one variable, where the phrase one variable means that there's a single input variable or feature x, namely the size of the house. Another name for a linear model with one input variable is univariate linear regression"
